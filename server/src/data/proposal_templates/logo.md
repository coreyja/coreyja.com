Hello, my name is Brandi Alexander. Thanks for considering me for your Logo Design!

My husband Corey and I have recently established a freelance consulting agency, Lavender Iguana. We would be thrilled to have you as one of our inaugural clients!

I am a UX designer who just finished a boot camp and, before that, got my bachelor's degree in psychology.
I've been working on my branding and logos and will include a few samples here! One of those was a complete branding project for a client who wanted to start a career coaching business for mental health professionals. You can find my case study of that project here: <https://brandialexander.design/case_studies/elizabeth_mattfeld>.

Logos and branding are essential elements of any business, as they help to convey a company's unique identity and values to its audience. A well-designed logo can make a lasting impression on potential customers. It can help to establish a company's credibility and professionalism. As a UX designer with a background in psychology, I understand the importance of creating a logo and branding that resonates with the target audience and effectively communicates the company's message.

Since Lavender Iguana is new, we can offer a great deal of $25 per hour for your logo!
It should take roughly 20 hours to go from sketches to finalized designs. With an estimated total cost of ~$500
This project will include the following:

- Initial sketches and concepts
- Revisions and finalization of the chosen design
- File formats for web and print use (JPG, PNG, PDF, EPS)
- Unique and custom designs with unlimited revisions
- Delivery within a week of finalizing the design

We at Lavender Iguana would love to work with you and are happy to answer any questions you may have!
Please don't hesitate to reach out
