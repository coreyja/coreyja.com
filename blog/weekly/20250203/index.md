Hey Team!

As is becoming normal, itâ€™s been awhile since I sent my last newsletter update.

Todayâ€™s will be short and sweet but I have exciting news to share!

## Newborn!

One reason I was less active at the end of the year is that me and my wife were planning for the arrival of our first child! And she was born on January 18th, 2025. Her name is Amelia, and both her and mom are doing great!

Been busy with taking care of both in the last few weeks, but took some time for myself recently to get this written and get everything ready to send this update out!

## Buttondown

One of the things I wanted to get done before sending out this update is migrating off of [Kit](https://kit.com/) (previously ConvertKit) to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/) as my newsletter provider.

They offer better pricing and features that I wanted like the ability to auto-assign tags without having to pay for the higher tier on Kit.

Iâ€™ll keep everyone here updated with how I like Buttondown, but the migration and setup process was pretty painless!

## Side Project Starter Kits

Iâ€™m still chugging away in the background on Side Project Starter Kits. This is my latest project idea to help engineers practice their coding on real world projects, without having to be also be product managers and designers. Iâ€™m excited to launch it, and the landing page is going to launch soon. Hopefully next week!

You can preview the [Landing Page here](https://sideprojectstarterkits.com/). If you want to follow along for updates enter your email on that page to sign up for my newsletter. Or if you are reading this from my newsletter you are good to go, youâ€™re already signed up to get all my updates!

And thatâ€™s about all I have today! Wanted to get an email sent out using Buttondown, but keeping it short.
Keep an eye out for the next newsletter which should launch Side Project Start Kits! ðŸŽ‰
