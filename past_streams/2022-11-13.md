Discover the power of Rust's generics and traits during this live stream documenting the ongoing development of a game project, BattleSnake. Recorded on November 13th, 2022, host Coreyja takes you step-by-step on how to implement a factory trait for generating different board types and how to utilize a marker trait for ensuring all traits are implemented. This live stream also covers other topics like code editor color schemes and kinks in creating a project with compiler-driven development. Tune in for learning and laughter, and walk away armed with fresh strategies for your own coding projects.

Warning: If you love deep coding dives, potential solutions to tricky bugs, and strategies for tricky generics, this video may result in increased coding know-how!
