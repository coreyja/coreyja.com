Coding Live Stream Recap: Join Corey as he delves deep into advanced error handling using Rust programming language in this coding live stream recorded on 2023-01-08. Discover the potential of visualizing trace data, implementing a wrapper around the HttpResponse type to handle JSON responses effectively, and creating a competitive mega snake combining multiple algorithms. The stream includes in-depth conversations about Rust libraries like `color_eyre` and `axum`. Experience the thrill of troubleshooting live, exploring different algorithms, and learn from Corey's thought process. Don't miss out on the chat discussion where participants give valuable insights and pitch in their own debugging techniques. Tune in, enhance your coding knowledge and be part of this collaborative learning experience.
