Join me, Corey, for an informative and interactive live stream session recorded on June 21, 2023 as I put finishing touches on my exciting Rust-powered blog and prepare for its launch. Watch as I delve into web development techniques, demonstrating my process using Figma for logo design, adjusting code for enhanced aesthetics, and tackling layout improvements. Witness real-time problem-solving as I work through issues with Font Awesome files and share insights into implementing CSS kits. Stay tuned till the end as I compare the new website version with the old one, evaluate changes, and gear up for the big launch. Follow along to pick up valuable tips for your own coding projects!
