In this video, I code an entire playable Halloween-themed "choose your own adventure" game from scratch in just 3 hours - all while dressed up in a full Jack Skellington costume and makeup! ðŸ’€

ðŸ‘‰ What to Expect
Watch me build the game live on stream, going through the full development process from idea to working prototype.

ðŸŽ¨ Why a Choose Your Own Adventure Game?
It's a unique idea that fits the Halloween theme! And building it myself lets me take viewers along for a fun coding journey.

ðŸ›  Technical Highlights
The project uses TypeScript, React, Bun, OpenAI and more. Key moments include setting up React and Tailwind CSS, building the Bun back-end, integrating OpenAI for story generation, adding voting functionality, and deploying the final game.

Play the game we made here and vote with everyone else to choose your own adventure!
