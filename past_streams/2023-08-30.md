Join us in this intense coding session recorded on August 30th 2023 where our host Corey takes his Rust skills up a notch.

In this follow-up session, we enhance our basic caching proxy to respect cache control headers like max-age using the `http-cache-semantics` crate. Dive deep into the world of caching, uncover the mystery behind Chrome's max-age=0 forcing our CDN not to cache responses, and watch as we tweak our system to perfection using Firefox for testing! Hang on till the end as we discuss next steps, including the anticipation of adding more cache nodes and persisting cache data using SQLite. Crucial learnings, interesting discussions and real-world coding challenges await you!
