Unravel the mysteries of coding as Corey, aka coreyja online, dives back into his progressive journey of building a CDN caching project, all in Rust. Recorded on September 23, 2023, join him in this 5th installment as he tackles the implementation of the LiteFS Halt mechanism, complete with all the highs and lows it entails, from syscall errors to potential workarounds and making plans for next stream!

The video promises an intriguing exploration of Corey's problem-solving approach when confronted with the challenge of the file locking mechanism, culminating in... nothing working! But we wrote down what we tried to prepare ourselves for next time!

So hit play, sit back, and get ready to embark on this coding quest, where not even the readonly DB error stands a chance!
