Join Corey in this productive coding session, recorded on September 1, 2023, as he makes significant progress in building a robust, caching Content Delivery Network (CDN) entirely in Rust. This stream is Part 3, where Corey successfully moves the cache from memory to a FileSystem and adds a SQLite Database for storing cache metadata.

In this insightful session Corey broadens the functionality of his CDN by including features like:

- Cache management and detailed debugging with '\_caje/list' endpoint.
- Serialization of data using 'postcard', an emerging technology.
- Future plans for deploying on Fly.io, making the CDN distributed and configurable.

It's an exciting journey into cache control and multi-node deployment. Ideal for Rust enthusiasts and budding programmers. Don't miss out! Make sure to catch up on Parts 1 & 2 if you haven't already.
