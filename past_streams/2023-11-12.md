🚀 Stream Highlights
In this engaging coding session, we tackled some exciting milestones for our MoodBoard app:

- Integrated with the Pexels API for an abundant image collection.
- Redid Database Modeling to account for code evolution
- Successfully deployed the app to Fly.io.
- Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions for efficient deployment.

🤔 Why Pexels, Not Pinterest?
We initially eyed Pinterest's API, but it was out of reach. Lucky for us, Pexels stepped in with its free and high-quality images. Discover why Pexels was our silver lining!

👨‍💻 Deep Dive into the Code
Join me, Corey, as I navigate the intricacies of Rust and Wasm in building our Moodboard app. From database caching to API pagination, I've covered it all. Dive in to see how I transformed ideas into code!

🔧 Tech Breakdown

Rust Ecosystem: Leveraging powerful libraries like axum for web framework, sqlx for async database operations, maud for HTML templating, and reqwest for HTTP requests.

SQLite Integration: Adding persistence to our app with robust database management.

Pexels API Magic: Fetching image collections seamlessly with API integration.

Docker & GitHub Actions: Streamlining the deployment process for consistent and reliable updates.

🔜 What's Next?
Stay tuned! We've got big plans for user modeling, database enhancements, and a fresh new look for creating moodboards.
