# Discord Interactive Threads Implementation Summary

## Overview

This branch introduces Discord interactive threads support to the Agentic Threads system, allowing the AI to maintain ongoing conversations in Discord threads rather than just working toward task completion.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**New Thread Types**:
- Added `thread_type` column to `threads` table with values: `autonomous` (default) and `interactive`
- Added `metadata` JSONB column to store Discord-specific data
- Created index on `metadata->'discord'->>'thread_id'` for efficient Discord thread lookups

**New Stitch Type**:
- Added `discord_message` stitch type to track incoming Discord messages
- Updated stitch type constraint to include the new type

**Migration**: `20250721011913_add_thread_type_and_metadata.sql`

### 2. Discord Metadata Structure

Threads now store Discord context in the metadata field:
```json
{
  "discord": {
    "channel_id": "string",
    "thread_id": "string", 
    "guild_id": "string",
    "webhook_url": "string (optional)",
    "last_message_id": "string (optional)",
    "participants": ["user#tag"],
    "created_by": "user#tag",
    "thread_name": "string"
  }
}
```

### 3. New Components

**DiscordEventHandler** (`server/src/discord_interactive.rs`):
- Handles incoming Discord messages and thread creation events
- Creates interactive threads when bot is mentioned in Discord threads
- Manages Discord metadata and participant tracking

**ProcessDiscordEvent Job** (`server/src/jobs/discord_event_processor.rs`):
- Processes Discord events (messages, thread creation)
- Creates discord_message stitches to maintain conversation history
- Updates thread metadata with latest message IDs
- Enqueues ProcessThreadStep for AI response generation

**Discord Tools** (`server/src/al/tools/discord.rs`):
- `SendDiscordMessage`: Send messages to specific Discord channels
- `SendDiscordThreadMessage`: Send messages to the current Discord thread context

### 4. Thread Model Extensions

**New Methods in Thread model**:
- `create_interactive()`: Creates a new interactive thread with metadata
- `find_by_discord_thread_id()`: Finds thread by Discord thread ID
- `update_metadata()`: Updates thread metadata

**New Stitch method**:
- `create_discord_message()`: Creates a stitch for incoming Discord messages

### 5. Architecture Pattern

The implementation follows this flow:
1. Discord event (message/thread creation) â†’ DiscordEventHandler
2. Handler creates/finds interactive thread and enqueues ProcessDiscordEvent job
3. ProcessDiscordEvent creates discord_message stitch and enqueues ProcessThreadStep
4. ProcessThreadStep runs with Discord context and can use Discord tools
5. AI responds using SendDiscordThreadMessage tool

### 6. Planning Documents

- `discord-interactive-threads-plan.md`: Detailed implementation plan and design decisions
- `discord-threads-abstraction-analysis.md`: Analysis of shared vs separate abstraction approaches

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Extend Existing System**: Rather than creating a separate system, Discord threads extend the existing Agentic Threads infrastructure
2. **Thread Type Differentiation**: Interactive threads never "complete" - they maintain ongoing conversations
3. **Metadata Flexibility**: Using JSONB metadata allows storing Discord-specific data without modifying core thread schema
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Discord events trigger jobs, maintaining the existing job-based processing model
5. **Context Preservation**: All Discord messages stored as stitches for full conversation history

## Current Status

This is Phase 1 implementation providing:
- Basic Discord thread creation and message handling
- Message sending capabilities
- Integration with existing thread processing system
- Conversation history tracking

## Future Enhancements

The plan outlines future phases including:
- Additional Discord tools (reactions, thread history, message editing)
- Conversation summarization for long threads
- Rate limiting and auto-pause functionality
- Command handling (/pause, /summarize, etc.)
- Hybrid threads that can spawn autonomous child threads
- Discord-specific metrics tracking

## Integration Notes

- The system currently has a limitation where enqueuing jobs from the event handler requires AppState (noted with TODO comments)
- Discord thread IDs are stored as strings in metadata and converted to u64 when needed for Discord API calls
- The system preserves the existing thread lifecycle while adapting it for interactive conversations
