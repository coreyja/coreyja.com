# Byte

Byte is our stream companion, and hopefully chat bot!
They are a work in progress, but we hope to have them up and running soon!

## Later Plans

- Think about a VAD to detect voice
  - Maybe Keyword detection to move the "Hey Byte" detection to the audio level
- Add commands that Byte can do
- Add Twitch Chat bot from stream interaction
- Add Discord bot for Discord interaction
- Add Database to act as 'brain'/memory for Byte
  - Idea being he can record things that happen on stream and then recall them later
