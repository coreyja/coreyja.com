# Global Coding Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.

## When to use this skill

- When writing any code in any programming language or framework
- When naming variables, functions, classes, methods, or files
- When formatting code with proper indentation, spacing, and line breaks
- When running automated formatters (Prettier, Black, rustfmt, gofmt, etc.)
- When running linters (ESLint, Pylint, Clippy, etc.) to enforce code standards
- When refactoring code to extract common logic into reusable functions
- When removing dead code, unused variables, or commented-out blocks
- When keeping functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- When applying the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- When writing meaningful, descriptive names that reveal intent
