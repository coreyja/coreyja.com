name: Backend Models
description: Define database models with clear naming, appropriate data types, proper constraints, and relationship definitions. Use this skill when creating or modifying ORM model files, database entity definitions, or data structure schemas. When defining table relationships, foreign keys, and cascade behaviors. When implementing model validation rules, timestamps, or indexes. When working with model files in frameworks like SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, ActiveRecord, SQLx, Prisma, or similar ORMs. When choosing appropriate data types for columns or establishing data integrity constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys).

# Backend Models

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.

- When defining table relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one)
- When establishing foreign key constraints and cascade behaviors
- When choosing appropriate data types for database columns
- When adding timestamps (created_at, updated_at) to models
- When implementing data integrity constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- When creating indexes on frequently queried columns
- When working with model validation at the ORM layer
- When defining model naming conventions (singular vs plural)
- When working with ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, ActiveRecord, SQLx, Diesel, or Prisma
