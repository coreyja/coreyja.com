- When refactoring existing components to improve reusability or composability
- When defining component props, interfaces, TypeScript types, or default values
- When managing local component state or deciding whether to lift state up
- When building reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs, modals, dropdowns)
- When implementing component composition patterns (children, slots, render props)
- When working with component files (.jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte, .js)
- When splitting large components into smaller, focused sub-components
- When documenting component usage, props, or creating component libraries
- When encapsulating component logic and keeping internal details private
