name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write focused tests for core user flows and critical business logic, testing behavior rather than implementation, with clear names and fast execution. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. When testing critical user workflows and primary application features. When creating tests that focus on what code does rather than how it does it. When mocking external dependencies like databases, APIs, or file systems. When naming tests to clearly describe the scenario and expected outcome. When keeping tests fast and independent. When completing feature implementation and adding strategic tests at logical completion points. When working with test files or test frameworks.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill

- When writing unit tests for functions, methods, or modules
- When writing integration tests for multiple components working together
- When writing end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- When testing core user flows and primary business-critical features
- When completing feature implementation and adding tests at logical completion points
- When creating tests that focus on behavior (what code does) rather than implementation (how it does it)
- When writing descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems, network calls)
- When ensuring tests run fast (milliseconds for unit tests)
- When working with test frameworks (Jest, pytest, RSpec, Rust's test framework, etc.)
