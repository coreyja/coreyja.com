name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, performant database queries using parameterized statements, proper indexing, and query optimization techniques. Use this skill when writing SQL queries, ORM query methods, or database access code. When implementing data fetching logic that retrieves or updates database records. When optimizing queries to prevent N+1 problems through eager loading or joins. When using WHERE clauses, JOIN operations, or ORDER BY statements. When implementing transactions for related database operations. When working with query builder methods, raw SQL, or ORM query interfaces. When setting query timeouts or implementing query result caching.

# Backend Queries

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.

## When to use this skill

- When writing SQL queries or ORM query methods to fetch or update data
- When implementing data retrieval logic in services, repositories, or data access layers
- When optimizing queries to avoid N+1 query problems (using eager loading, joins, or includes)
- When using WHERE clauses, JOIN operations, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY statements
- When selecting specific columns instead of using SELECT *
- When wrapping related database operations in transactions
- When implementing query timeouts or error handling for database calls
- When working with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- When adding indexes to columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY
- When caching expensive or frequently-run query results
