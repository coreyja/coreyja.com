name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles, consistent naming conventions, and proper HTTP methods. Use this skill when creating or modifying API routes, controllers, or handlers in backend code. When implementing endpoint logic that handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). When working with API versioning, query parameters, or response formatting. When defining URL structures for resource-based endpoints. When setting up rate limiting or HTTP status code handling. When working with files like route definitions, controller files, API handler modules, or web framework configuration files.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying API routes, endpoints, or URL patterns
- When implementing controllers or handlers that process HTTP requests
- When working with RESTful resource definitions (e.g., `/users`, `/products`)
- When setting up API versioning strategies
- When configuring query parameters for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When defining HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When implementing rate limiting or response headers
- When working with web framework route files (e.g., routes.js, api.rs, controllers/)
- When designing nested resource endpoints
- When setting up HTTP status code responses
