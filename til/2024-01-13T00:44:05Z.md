Here is a quick view of this Rust powered site as its been built! It does that annoying jumping in the middle when I didn't have consistent font loading, all fixed now!

I've been using [shot-scraper](https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/) by simonw to take screenshots of my blog and save them to my repo.

That means I have a history of what my site has been looking in prod!

So I throw together a [small Rust script](https://github.com/coreyja/coreyja.com/blob/main/scripts/create_blog_history_video.rs) calls out to `ffmpeg` that compiles all the screenshots I have saved into a short movie

I'll try to post a new one at the end of the year and we can see how it changes!
