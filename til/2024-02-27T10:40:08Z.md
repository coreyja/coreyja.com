Yesterday I ran into a small problem with my Axum routing for my blog.
So today I wanted to take 10 minutes and do quick write up about it!

My blog uses `Axum` as its Web Framework of choice. I was looking through some old emails and found one where a reader reached out about a post I made! (It was [this one about FZF Spell Checking in VIM](https://coreyja.com/posts/vim-spelling-suggestions-fzf/))

But I realized that it was linking to an older URL format, The link was to 
`https://coreyja.com/https://coreyja.com/blog/2018/11/10/vim-spelling-suggestions-fzf.html`!

And you can see I was using a different URL structure then, and my current blog didn't have a redirect setup!

And that was our goal! I wanted `https://coreyja.com/blog/2018/11/10/vim-spelling-suggestions-fzf.html` to redirect to `/posts/vim-spelling-suggestions-fzf`.
And I also decided that I wanted `blog/anything-else-here` to redirect to `/posts`

Simple enough!

I added these two routes to my Axum Router function:

```rust
.route("/blog/:year/:month/:date/:slug", get(redirect_to_new_post_url))
.route("/blog/*catchall", get(redirect_to_posts_index))
```

And I expected this to work out of the box! But it didn't :sadnerd:

Instead I got an error about conflicting routes. Luckily the answer is relatively easy, at least in my case!
I just needed to use `nest` to target all the `/blog` urls and then use a `fallback`. Here is what I ended up with!

```rust
.nest(
  "/blog",
  Router::new()
    .route("/:year/:month/:date/:slug", get(redirect_to_new_post_url))
    .fallback(redirect_to_posts_index)
)
```

And now I was able to get all the redirects working as I wanted! Go check out that 'old' URL above now and with any luck you should be redirected to the right post!
