Today I was trying to remember the name of the documentation framework that splits docs into four quadrants — tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation. It's called **Diátaxis**.

The site is [diataxis.fr](https://diataxis.fr/) and it's by Daniele Procida.

Mostly posting this so I can find the link next time I forget the name!
