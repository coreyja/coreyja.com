I've been using `sqlx` as my main DB client in Rust for my personal projects.

And today I needed to add some tests that would interact with the DB.
I'd been trying to do more integration tests, without reading the DB directly,
but to test a certain bug it was the best way to go.

I had a `#[tokio::test]` that would connect to the DB and run the specs. It was
working great locally, but in CI it was failing to compile since `sqlx` didn't know
about the queries in the test files, as they were not in the `.sqlx` files that the CLI
generated.

Running `cargo sqlx prepare --workspace --all` was NOT enough to get it to 'see' the
test queries.

The fix was to run the following
```
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace --all -- --all-targets
```

The `-- --all-targets` is the magic flag that sqlx passes to Cargo, and the `--all-targets`
will build the tests and docs, as well as the main project.

TLDR: So now I added a `scripts/sqlx.sh` script that simply runs `cargo sqlx prepare --workspace --all -- --all-targets`.

Bonus content! I also found out about [`#[sqlx::test]`](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/attr.test.html) which does all the testing DB setup and tear down for me! Was able to remove a good chunk of test setup code when I found this macro today.
